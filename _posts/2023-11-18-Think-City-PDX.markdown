I was sad to see John Mayer's Think City PDX blog disappear a few years ago. It was full of useful 
technical info about the Think City written from a technician's perspective. 
Luckily, fellow Think afficionado Frank Smith had the 
foresight to archive the site before it went down.
I've uploaded his mirror of the Think City PDX Blog to [https://hrmnc.github.io/ThinkCityPDX/](https://hrmnc.github.io/ThinkCityPDX/) 
so that future enthusiasts can reference the info. Thanks to Frank for sharing the data!
